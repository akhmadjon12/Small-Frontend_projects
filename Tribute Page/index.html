        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1889 | He met Max Talmud</strong> - Max introduced Albert to math and science. Albert was ten years old.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1894 | Albert finishes school</strong> -  Albert finished his schooling in Munich with medical training. He moved to Milan with his family.

  Albert Einstein got a job in the patent office. He used his understanding of math and science in his new position, and it made him happy.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1905 | Submits his first paper
  </strong> - Einstein submitted his first paper on his theory of thermodynamics. It was the first of many.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1909 | A new job</strong> - After working at the patent office and writing his theories, Einstein got a job teaching theoretical physics at the University of Zurich.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1911 | Attends physics conference</strong> - He was given an invitation to the first-ever world physics conference. He was the youngest physicist there.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1913 | Theory of gravity</strong> - He believed science's understanding of gravity was wrong, and he worked on a new theory which he would later test with a solar eclipse.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1922 | Nobel Prize</strong> - Einstein was awarded his first Nobel Prize. He was on his way to Japan when he got the news.</li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>1945 | War ends</strong> - World War II ended and Einstein continued his research. He made advances in heat, gravity, and relativity, and he published over 300 scientific reports.
        </li>
        <li><strong>1955 | Einstein dies</strong> - Albert Einstein died in April of heart failure.</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p>
          "Albert Einstein was one of the worlds' great thinkers. He came up with many of the theories we know today are facts-like how gravity works. This is a timeline of the big moments in his life."
